# Educational movie recommendation project

Main goal of this project was to get some basic experience at recommendations algorithms and at Data Science in general.
This project is based on TMDB movies dataset and can recommend you movies based on the one you want and predict success
of some hypothetical movie parameters of which you enter

This project contains of:
1) Models part created with scikit, pandas e.t.c
2) Back-end sever based on Flask
3) Front-end forms created with Vue.js

### Prerequisites

You will need to have some version of Python 3 on your computer in order to run this app. I was using the 3.7 one from 
Miniconda. You can get the latest one in [Miniconda portal](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or  just get 
one from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)

You might also need to install additional packages via pip

```
pip install flask
```

For Vue.js you will need node.js on your computer. You can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or from 
the repository of your OS

```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

## Getting Started

To get this project just clone it with
```
git clone https://github.com/SAmser93/movie_recommendations_project
```

### Installing

Use the _build_dev.sh_ script in the main directory or read it for instructions
First launch can take some time because of resources unzipping

## Deployment

Section under construction

## Built With

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - it's dataframe used in models
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - used for models creation
* [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) - used for models backend
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - used to build front-end application
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - used to create front-end pages and their logic
